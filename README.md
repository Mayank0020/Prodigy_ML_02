## Contents

The repository contains the following file:- 

1.  task2.ipynb : A jupyter notebook including the code of the K-means Clustering Algorithm
2.  Mall_customer.csv : A CSV file containing cutomer ID's and their spending scores

## Getting Started :-

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required python libraries from requirments.txt
